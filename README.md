# Baking App :cake: :pizza:

Baking App is a recipe viewer application developed as part of the [Udacity Android Nanodegree](https://in.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)
project.

## Project Breakdown
- [x] ~Get initial project up and running~

- [x] ~Create a barebones application~
  - ~Load and display recipes from the network~
  - ~Display ingredients~
  - ~Diplay basic (text) steps (no videos) for the recipe~

- [x] ~Add `ExoPlayer` to view recipe videos~

- [ ] Add Espresso UI testing
  - Adding Espresso tests now will help us detect regressions later when we update the UI

- [ ] Give the UI a modern look-n-feel!

- [ ] Implement a homescreen widget for the app
  - Widget _should_ diplay steps for the currently selected recipe
